        <h2>Branching</h2>
        <p>
            Branching gives you the ability to work on a feature without disturbing the master version of the code. 
            Each branch is going to have its own name the "master" branch that has the stable code and a "feature" 
            branch, where you working on a feature.  At anyone time, you are only working on one of the branches.  
            The current state you are working on is called the head.  You can switch between branches by nominating the 
            head.  Once you are happy with the feature you can merge the branches.
        </p>
